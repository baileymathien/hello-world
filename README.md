Our program takes in a name and age input from the user. It then takes this age input, adds 5 to it, and prints out a message that displays the user's age in 5 years.

We chose this specific code of conduct because it clearly outlines who can and who cannot participate in our project.
We chose this license because it illustrates how an individual can use our program.
